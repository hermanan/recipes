Traditional Cocada

1 lb grated coconut

1 lb sugar

1 cup water

Dissolve sugar in water and boil the mixture until it spins a thread (I use a candy thermometer; 232 to 234Â° F). Remove syrup from heat and add the grated coconut. Stir well until it becomes sugary. Pour onto a buttered platter (a marble pizza stone is great for that purpose) and let cool, then cut into squares (about two inches).
